### Arithmetic operators

Python can operate with numbers using the usual mathematical operators, and some special operators, too. These are all of them (we'll explore the last two in later videos).

- a + b = Adds a and b
- a - b = Subtracts b from a
- a * b = Multiplies a and b
- a / b = Divides a by b
- a ** b = Elevates a to the power of b. For non integer values of b, this becomes a root (i.e. a**(1/2) is the square root of a)
- a // b = The integer part of the integer division of a by b
- a % b = The remainder part of the integer division of a by b


### Comparison operators

- a == b: a is equal to b
- a != b: a is different than b
- a < b: a is smaller than b
- a <= b: a is smaller or equal to b
- a > b: a is bigger than b
- a >= b: a is bigger or equal to b

### Logical operators

- a and b: True if both a and b are True. False otherwise.
- a or b: True if either a or b or both are True. False if both are False.
- not a: True if a is False, False if a is True.
